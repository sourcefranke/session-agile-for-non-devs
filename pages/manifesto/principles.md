<li>
    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
</li>

<li>
    Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
    Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
</li>

<li>
    Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
</li>

<li>
    Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
</li>

<li>
    Build projects around motivated individuals.
    Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
</li>

<li>
    The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
</li>

<li>
    Working software is the primary measure of progress.
</li>

<li>
    Agile processes promote sustainable development.
    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
</li>

<li>
    Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
</li>

<li>
    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
</li>

<li>
    The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
</li>

<li>
    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
</li>
