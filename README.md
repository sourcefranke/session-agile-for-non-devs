# Agile Manifesto for non-devs

These are my presentation slides for a session about the Agile Manifesto.
My intention for this session.

So developers are not my main target group, but can use the material as some kind of reminder.

## [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- visit http://localhost:3030

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes.

Learn more about Slidev on [documentations](https://sli.dev/).
